These are just some small project I've created. They are in fact part of a bigger solution so here there look like disconnected parts. 

--------------

STYLE MANAGER

This is an internal project used as a library in other projects of the company.

It has two main purposes:

- To serve as a style setting for those projects, such as the colors used in a form, keyboard shortcuts, etc. In this case, it is used as a library wich offers methods and properties useful for other projects.

- To provide the basic user interface (forms) to configure thouse styles. These forms are mainly designed to be used by a developer, and just a few of them (for example, FrmReglas) may be used by a system user.  

--------------

COMMUNICATION MANAGER

This includes some forms used to register the communication with customers, suppliers, and users, and to display those communications in much the same way as email conversation threads.

--------------

DYNAMIC REPORTS

It allows you to create new Reports without designing, coding and publishing a new version of the software. A technical user must  provide an SQL query, specify columns to display and filters to apply, so that later a system user can process the specified report.

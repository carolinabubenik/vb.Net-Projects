STYLE MANAGER

This is an internal project used as a library in other projects of the company.

It has two main purposes:

- To serve as a style setting for those projects, such as the colors used in a form, keyboard shortcuts, etc. In this case, it is used as a library wich offers methods and properties useful for other projects.

- To provide the basic user interface (forms) to configure thouse styles. These forms are mainly designed to be used by a developer, and just a few of them (for example, FrmReglas) may be used by a system user.
